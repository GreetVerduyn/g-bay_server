# g-bay_server

creating a new directory for the server side

- I made a new repo and copied this files from our 1st repo into it

  (- server
    - package.json
    - package-lock.json) 

- then I run : 
  - npm install
  - npm start

My server works on localhost:3001/api

- then I go to GitHub and create a new branch (production), which I make the default branch.
- next stap is to invite my colleges for this directory
