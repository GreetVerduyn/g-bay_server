== PROJECT STRUCTURE (server)

What would be a good project structure for a Node.js application?

https://bytearcher.com/articles/node-project-structure/

Small applications don't matter that much, but for larger apps with more complex logic, it's worth thinking
about the project structure.

One way to organize a project is to use three-layer architecture.

=== Three-layer architecture

The project is structured into three layers: API, Service and Integration layers.

Each layer has a specific set of responsibilities that are clearly defined and easy to grasp.
Each layer accesses the layer below it, never above it.
Serving a request touches each layer starting from the top, traveling all the way down,
and then resurfacing back to the topmost layer.


=== API layer

The API Layer is responsible for receiving the HTTP request and parsing the payload from it.
This layer would then forward the payload removed of any HTTP-specific items to the following Service layer.

Express.js lives only on this level. You'd have your main app.js that set up the server and individual route files.
Route files define validations and call service layers, leaving all req and res objects behind.


=== Service layer

The Service Layer is responsible for performing business logic, i.e. making things happen.
It's agnostic of any HTTP specific constructs, and the caller could as well as be a command-line application,
a timer job or a test suite. Input is plain vanilla JavaScript objects instead of JSON.

Services perform business logic. They validate inputs against business rules and call other services in the Service layer.
If they need to talk to outside systems, they use the Integration layer to do that.


=== Integration layer

The code in the Integration Layer is responsible for performing I/O outside the process boundaries.
It talks to databases and makes HTTP requests to 3rd party web APIs.

Most of the contents in this layer would be higher abstraction clients.
For example, a client handling the communication to a web API would accept vanilla objects as arguments
and would hide the complexity of formulating an HTTP request payload and making the call.


=== Clear responsibilities

This division achieves separation of concerns. Each layer has a specific responsibility,
and it translates well into a directory structure.

You could translate this architecture into a project structure by having a separate directory for each layer.

== NODE.JS

Node.js is an open source cross-platform runtime environment written in JavaScript.
It is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, which parses and executes the JavaScript code.
Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it fast and lightweight.

Node is *best suited* for building *software and applications* that *require real-time,
synchronous interactions* such as chat apps and websites.
Yet it also has other uses and benefits which make it popular among developers, as well, all contributing to its popularity.

===  Why It Is Called Node

It’s called Node because it is used to build simple single-process blocks called nodes.
These nodes can be organized with good networking protocols for communication with each other
and be scaled up to build large distributed programs.


=== 3. Non-blocking in Node

This is the main feature of Node. You need to understand how inout/output (I/O) operations
(This includes HTTP requests, database operations and disk reads and writes) in Node are performed asynchronously,
with the lines of code adhering to a non blocking pattern.
The single thread of execution asks the runtime to perform an operation, providing a callback function
and then moves on to do something else. When the operation has been completed, a message is enqueued
along with the provided callback function.
At some point in the future, the message is dequeued and the callback fired.

* Give Node instructions (a function) to execute.
    * Give the function some arguments.
    * Give Node a callback with your function.
    * Node will proceed to take instructions from other lines after yours.
    * When your function has been computed, Node will call your callback with the result of the computation.


=== 4.Concept of the Event Loop
https://blog.carbonfive.com/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/

Basically, there is a stack, a heap, and a queue. In a loop, the queue is polled for the next message
and when a message is encountered, the callback for that message is executed.
The decoupling of the caller from the response allows for the JavaScript runtime to do other things
while waiting for your asynchronous operation to complete and their callbacks to fire.
But where in memory do these callbacks live – and in what order are they executed?
What causes them to be called? JavaScript runtimes contain a message queue which stores a list of messages to be processed
and their associated callback functions. These messages are queued in response to external events
(such as a mouse being clicked or receiving the response to an HTTP request) given a callback function has been provided.
If, for example a user were to click a button and no callback function was provided –
no message would have been enqueued. In a loop, the queue is polled for the next message
(each poll referred to as a “tick”) and when a message is encountered, the callback for that message is executed.


image::images/image-2022-08-19-15-29-17-481.png[width=600]

The calling of this callback function serves as the initial frame in the call stack, and due to JavaScript being single-threaded,
further message polling and processing is halted pending the return of all calls on the stack.
Subsequent (synchronous) function calls add new call frames to the stack
(for example, function init calls function changeColor).

*Node JS is* a fast JavaScript *runtime* environment that we use *to build server-side applications*,
but it does not know how to perform serving files, handling requests, and handling HTTP methods,
so this is where express js comes in.

*Express JS is a Node.js framework* designed to build API's web applications cross-platform mobile apps quickly
and make node js easy

=== What Is Express JS In Node JS?

Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.
It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

=== Why Express JS?

* Express was created to make APIs and web applications with ease,
    * It saves a lot of coding time almost by half
    * makes web and mobile applications are efficient.
    * It is written in javascript

The reason behind creating an express framework for node js is:

* Time-efficient
    * Fast
    * Economical
    * Easy to learn
    * Asynchronous

=== Features of Express JS

* Fast Server-Side Development: The features of node js help express saving a lot of time.

    * Middleware: is a request handler that has access to the application's request-response cycle.

    * Routing: It refers to how an application's endpoint's URLs respond to client requests.

    * Templating: It provides templating engines to build dynamic content on the web pages by creating HTML templates on the server.

    * Debugging: Express makes it easier as it identifies the exact part where bugs are.


=== Advantages of Using Express With Node.js

* Express is Unopinionated, and we can customize it.
    * For request handling, we can use Middleware.
    * A single language is used for frontend and backend development.
    * Express is fast to link it with databases like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
    * Express allows dynamic rendering of HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.


=== Limitations of Express JS

* Sometimes, there is no structural way to organize things, and the code becomes non-understandable.
    * There are so many issues with callbacks.
    * The error messages that will come are challenging to understand.

=== Installation and the First Program

To install Express JS on your system first you need to install node js
then we will write a command to install express in the terminal.

    npm install express

The express js will be installed in your system.

== CORS
https://stackabuse.com/handling-cors-with-node-js/

=== What is CORS
CORS is shorthand for *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing*.
It is a mechanism to allow or restrict requested resources on a web server depend on where the HTTP request was initiated.

This policy is used to secure a certain web server from access by other website or domain.
For example, only the allowed domains will be able to access hosted files in a server such as a stylesheet, image, or a script.

If you are currently on http://example.com/page1 and you are referring an image from http://image.com/myimage.jpg
you won't be able to fetch that image unless http://image.com allows cross-origin sharing with http://example.com.

There is an HTTP header called origin in each HTTP request. It defines from where the domain request has originated.
We can use header information to restrict or allow resources from our web server to protect them.


NOTE: By default requests from any other origins will be restricted by the browser.

For example, while you are still in the development stage - if you are using a frontend library such as React,
your front end application will be served on http://localhost:3000.
Meanwhile, your Express server might be running on a different port such as http://localhost:2020.

Because of this, you'll need to allow CORS between those servers.
If you see this common error in your browser console. CORS restrictions could be the issue:

image::images/image-2022-08-19-16-15-06-822.png[width=700]

CORS is really useful when you're offering a public API and would like to control the access to certain resources
and how people use them.

Also, if you want to use your own API or files on a different web page you can simply configure CORS to allow that,
while still blocking others out.

==== HOW TO?:
1. configure CORS with Express

Start off with a fresh project.
install the required modules. We'll be using express and the cors middleware:

Then create an express web application with two routes

Make a file, called index.js that acts as a web server, with a couple of request handlers, so you can run the app and the server:

[start=2]
2. Enable All CORS Requests

If you want to enable CORS for all the request you can simply use the cors middleware before configuring your routes:

 const express = require('express');
 const cors = require('cors');

 const app = express();

 app.use(cors())

 ......

This will allow all the routes to be accessed anywhere on the web if that is what you need.
For example, if our server is running on http://www.example.com and serves content such as images - we allow other domains,
such as http://www.differentdomain.com to refer the content from http://www.example.com.

[start=3]
3. Enable CORS for a Single Route

But if you need a certain route to be accessible and not other routes, you can configure cors in a certain route as a
middleware instead of configuring it to the whole app:

This will allow a certain route to be accessible by any domain.
For example, if you try to send a fetch request to the / path from a different origin -
it will be successful.

But if you try to access any other path other than the root path this request will be blocked by the browser:

[start=4]
4. Configure CORS with Options

You can also use the configuration options with CORS to customize this further.
You can use configuration to allow a single domain or subdomains access, configure HTTP methods that are allowed
such as GET and POST depending on your requirements.
If you configure the domain name in the origin - the server will allow CORS from the configured domain.

You can also configure allowed HTTP methods if you'd like:

for example: A POST request will be blocked by the browser if only GET and PUT are supported:

[start=5]
5. Configuring Dynamic CORS Origins using a Function

If configurations do not satisfy your requirements, you can create your function to customize CORS.

[start=6]
6. Loading List of Allowed Origins from as Data Source

You can use also use a list of allowed domains from a database or using any backing data source to allow CORS:

== HEADERS
https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-set-headers-in-request-in-nodejs

A header node is a special node that is found at the beginning of the list.
A list that contains this type of node, is called the header-linked list.
This type of list is useful when information other than that found in each node is needed.
For example, suppose there is an application in which the number of items in a list is often calculated.
Usually, a list is always traversed to find the length of the list.
However, if the current length is maintained in an additional header node that information can be easily obtained.

We will use request.setHeader() to set header of our request. The header tells the server details
about the request such as what type of data the client, user, or request wants in the response.
